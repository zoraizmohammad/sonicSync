_SonicSync_ is a submersible wearable apparatus created in collaboration with **Garmin International Inc.** which enables real-time feedback from divers underwater, improving warnings for dive conditions, neutral buoyancy, target depth, and variometric usage. It employs an effective data collection and signal analysis algorithm dedicated for efficiently analyzing data regarding different pitches, timbers, and audible tones at varying depths of water.

_SonicSync_ is a system with 98% accuracy in receiving specific diver feedback. To streamline communication between the device and a laptop, a tailored diver protocol leverages an optimized Bluetooth buoy, targeting a low latency bi-directional data transfer.
